  - JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
      Use Case: Best for photographs and realistic images with smooth variations in color and tone.
      Strengths: Offers good compression that balances quality and file size, widely supported.
      Limitations: Lossy compression can degrade quality with high compression levels; does not support transparency.

  - PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
      Use Case: Ideal for images that require transparency or images with text, sharp edges, and logos.
      Strengths: Lossless compression; supports transparency (alpha channel).
      Limitations: Larger file sizes compared to JPEG for high-color images like photographs.

  - GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)
      Use Case: Suitable for simple icons and animations.
      Strengths: Supports animations and transparency.
      Limitations: Limited to 256 colors, which makes it unsuitable for color-rich images.

  - WebP
      Use Case: A modern format designed to provide superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web.
      Strengths: Supports transparency and animation; can provide 25% to 34% better compression than JPEG and PNG, resulting in faster downloads and less data consumption.
      Limitations: Not fully supported in all browsers, but support is growing.
  
  - SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
      Use Case: Best for logos, icons, and other designs that require scalability without loss of quality.
      Strengths: Vector format, which means it remains crisp and clear at any resolution or zoom level; can be manipulated with CSS and JavaScript.
      Limitations: More complex to create than raster images; not ideal for complex images like photographs.

      <h2>Best Practices for Using Image Formats</h2>
      <pre>
      - Optimize Images: Always optimize images for the web to reduce file size without compromising quality. 
      Tools like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, and online optimizers can be used.

      - Choose Format Based on Need: Select image formats based on the specific needs of the content. 
      Use JPEG for complex images with many colors, 
      PNG for images requiring transparency, 
      WebP for a balance of quality and performance where supported, 
      SVG for scalable images like logos, and 
      GIF for simple animations.

      - Test for Compatibility: Ensure that the chosen image formats are compatible with all target browsers and devices. 
      Consider providing fallbacks for formats like WebP if targeting browsers that do not support it.

      - Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for images to improve page load times and conserve bandwidth, 
      especially for image-heavy pages.

      </pre>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <pre>
        Understanding the strengths and limitations of each image format allows web developers to make informed decisions 
        that optimize website performance and user experience. 
        By choosing the right format for the right task, developers can significantly improve the efficiency of webpages.

      <p>Responsive Image Example Using srcset</p>

      <!-- 
        srcset: Provides a list of alternative images for the browser.
          - Each image is listed with a width descriptor (e.g., 320w, 540w, 750w).
          - The browser chooses the best image to download based on screen size and resolution.

        sizes: Defines how much space (in CSS pixels) the image will take in different viewport sizes.
          - This helps the browser choose the best image from srcset before downloading.
      
        Summary: 
          - The browser selects the most appropriate image from srcset based on the viewport size and pixel density.
          - Example: A desktop might need a high-resolution image, while a mobile device may need a smaller one.
