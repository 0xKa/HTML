    <h3>What are HTML Entities</h3>
        • Definition: HTML entities are predefined code
            snippets that begin with an ampersand (&) and
            end with a semicolon (;).
        • They are used to display characters that have
            special significance in HTML or that cannot be
            typed directly into an HTML document.
        • If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>)
            signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix
            them with tags.
    
      
      <h3>How to Use</h3>
        • To Display Reserved Characters: Characters like
            < (less than) and > (greater than) are part of
            HTML syntax for tags. To display these
            characters on a webpage, you need to use their
            entities: & lt; and & gt;.
        • Special Characters: For characters that aren't
            available on a standard keyboard, such as
            (copyright), the entity & copy; is used.
        • Character Encoding Issues: HTML entities can
            help avoid problems with browsers interpreting
            the wrong character set.

      <h3>Example</h3>
        - Less Than: &lt;
        - Empty Small Square: &EmptySmallSquare;
        - Bullet Point:  &bullet;
        - Sum Sigma: &sum;
        - Emoji: &#128514;
        - White Spaces: (&NonBreakingSpace;&NonBreakingSpace;&NonBreakingSpace;&NonBreakingSpace;)
