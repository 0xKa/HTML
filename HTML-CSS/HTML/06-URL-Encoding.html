    <h3>Example</h3>
    • In this URL:
    <img src="./imgs/misc/url-example.jpg" alt=""> <br>
    • The search query for "hello world" includes a space between "hello" and "world", 
    which is encoded as %20.
    
    • The category "books&magazines" includes an ampersand, which is encoded as %26.
      
      <h3>What is URL Encoding?</h3>
      
  <u>Definition:</u>
  
  • URL encoding converts characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet. 
  URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character set.
  
  • Since URLs often contain characters outside the ASCII set, 
  URL encoding replaces unsafe ASCII characters with a "%" followed by two
  hexadecimal digits that represent the ASCII code of the character.
  
  <u>Why Use URL Encoding?</u>
  
  • Safety: URL encoding replaces unsafe characters that might be confusing to 
  web servers and browsers, such as spaces or punctuation.
  
  • Compatibility: Ensures that URLs, which often include characters outside the 
  ASCII set, are compatible across different browsers and servers.
  
  <u>How Does URL Encoding Work?</u>
  
  • Characters that have special meanings in URLs (like ?, &, =, #, etc.) 
  or non-alphanumeric characters are replaced by a % followed by 
  two hexadecimal values that correspond to their ISO8859-1 (or Latin-1) codes.
  
  • For example, a space character ( ) is replaced by %20.
  
  <u>Common URL Encoded Values</u>

    • Space ( ) is encoded as %20
    • Double Quote (") is encoded as %22
    • Plus Sign (+) is encoded as %2B
    • Forward Slash (/) is encoded as %2F
    • Question Mark (?) is encoded as %3F
    • Ampersand (&) is encoded as %26
    • Equals Sign (=) is encoded as %3D

  <u>Best Practices</u>

  • Always Encode Query Strings: Any data that forms part of a URL's query string should 
      be URL encoded to prevent misinterpretation of URL parameters by servers and applications.

  • Use Built-in Functions for Encoding:
      Most programming languages provide functions for URL encoding.

  • For example, in JavaScript, you can use
      encodeURIComponent() to encode a URL component.
