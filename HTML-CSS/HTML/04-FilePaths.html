  <h3>What are File Paths</h3>
        A file path in HTML specifies the location of a file within the computer or on a network.
    This allows HTML documents to locate and access resources like 
    images, videos, stylesheets, and other HTML pages. 
    Understanding how to specify these paths correctly is essential 
    for your web content to load and display correctly.
    
    <h4>Types of File Paths
    </h4>
    
<u>Absolute Path:</u>
    Description: An absolute path points directly to a resource on the internet using a full URL, 
    which includes the protocol (http:// or https://), domain name, and file structure.
    Example: https://www.example.com/images/logo.png
    Usage: Use when referring to resources that are hosted on different 
    servers or when the absolute reference is necessary.


<u>Relative Path:</u>
    Description: A relative path points to a file relative to the current file's location. 
    This is more flexible than absolute paths because it changes 
    contextually based on the location of the HTML file using it.
    
    <u>Types:</u>

    <u>Document-relative path:</u> 
        Links to a file in a directory structure relative to the current document.
        
        Example: images/logo.png 
        (Assuming the image is in the images folder in the same directory as the HTML file)

    <u>Root-relative path:</u>
        Starts with a slash (/) and links to a file based on the root directory of the site.
        
        Example: /images/logo.png 
        (Useful in larger websites where the directory structure is complex)


<u>Using File Paths in HTML</u>
 
    Linking an Image:
    < img src="images/logo.png" alt="Website Logo">
         - Here, src uses a relative path to point to an image within the same website.

    Linking a Stylesheet:
    < link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css">
        - href uses a root-relative path to ensure the CSS file can be 
          consistently accessed from any HTML document within the site.


    Linking a JavaScript File:
    <`script src="../scripts/app.js">< /script>
        - This example uses a document-relative path that goes up one directory level 
          (indicated by ../) before accessing the scripts directory.
        
<u>Best Practices</u>          
    - Use relative paths for resources hosted within the same site 
        to ensure portability and flexibility of the website structure.

    - Use absolute paths for resources from different domains 
        or when necessary to avoid confusion.

    - Consistently organize files in a logical directory structure
         to make managing relative paths easier.

    - Test file paths to ensure they reference the correct files,
         especially after restructuring directories.

    -- Use relative paths during development for flexibility.
    -- Use root-relative or absolute in production if your site is hosted in a stable structure.
